Leaders in an array

Input:
n = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: The first leader is 17 
as it is greater than all the elements
to its right.  Similarly, the next 
leader is 5. The right most element 
is always a leader so it is also 
included.


#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution{
public:
    vector<int> leaders(int a[], int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            bool leader = true;
            
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (a[j] > a[i]) {
                    leader = false;
                    break; // No need to continue checking if a[j] > a[i]
                }
            }
            
            if (leader) {
                ans.push_back(a[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
